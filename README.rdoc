# Keep Your Friends Close

KYFC is an applicationn that our group created as a final project for Dev Bootcamp. We built it in rails. To get it started, deploy it like any other application. You will also need a websocket server to propagate messages. You can see an example of one such server here: https://github.com/sorenpeterson/kyfcws
